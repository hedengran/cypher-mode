* A Cypher and Neo4j Emacs package

Cypher-mode is an Emacs major mode for editing and running Cypher queries in Neo4j.

** Overview

*** Running Neo4j

To run queries, cypher-mode requires an actively running Neo4j instance.
If you don't already have a Neo4j instance running in the background, you can launch a background process with `cypher-run-neo4j`.


*** Running queries

Queries can be sent from the buffer to `cypher-shell`.
The simplest way of running a query in the buffer is to run `C-c C-c`, or `cypher-send-buffer-or-region`.
If a region is currently highlighted, the function will send that region.
Otherwise, it will send the entire **.
